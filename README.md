May 2022
1. Answer BOTH parts of the question
Your research company is developing a new drug and would like to proceed with the preclinical toxicology studies. They agree to start with a preliminary acute dose range finding study and have decided on an initial starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight.
a) How would you carry out the preliminary dose range finding study and what considerations are needed when designing animal studies?    (50 % of marks)
It has been shown that the drug is metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 in vivo to form. a reactive species. The company are concerned about possible liver toxicity and mutagenic potential.
b) Discuss the reasons for their concern and the mechanism by which liver injury could occur following administration with this drug. Suggest one test you could carry out to determine if the drug is mutagenic.    (50 % of marks)

Discuss the benefits of a patient centric approach for this drug and outline the importance of a risk management plan and the information that should be included in it. Give examples, where appropriate.    (100 % of marks)
3. Discuss the physicochemical properties you would consider as important for a lead optimisation process when you wish to optimise the absorption and distribution properties of a potent compound?       (100 % of marks)
4. Answer BOTH parts of the question
a) Explain, using examples, what you understand by the terms “conditional marketing authorisation” and “emergency marketing authorisation”, and make reference to the rolling review process.    (20% of marks)
